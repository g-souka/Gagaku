# Gagaku
Puredata project inspired by the imperial court music of Japan named Gagaku.

This puredata project is composed of many abstractions and two main project files:
<ul>
  <li> gagaku-01-UI
  <li> gagaku-01-UI-master
</ul>

The master version is the one used for playing and the UI one contains everything.
All the files must be placed inside the same folder in order for the project to operate correctly.

The following puredata objects/libraries must be installed:
<ul>
  <li> freeverb
  <li> cyclone
</ul>

The following video contains sound produced solely using this project â€” https://youtu.be/rUoHir6cSf8



Further explanations will be added soon.
